Our Project is meant to be a service that can help users find information about all different kinds of dog breeds. Whether that be cute pictures, learning about a particular breed or even looking to adopt. With this website, users can learn everything about dogs, and even where to obtain one.

We plan to have compatibility for our website desktop devices.
